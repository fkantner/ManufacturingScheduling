# ManufacturingScheduling

This repository is to be used for prototyping and simulating manufacturing schedulers. The concept is to randomize
workcenters and process orders for a job shop simulation. Input would need to be a scheduling algorithm that would
handle the process orders through the workcenters as appropriate.
