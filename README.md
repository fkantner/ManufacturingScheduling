# ManufacturingScheduling

This repository is to be used for prototyping and simulating manufacturing schedulers. The concept is to randomize
workcenters and process orders for a job shop simulation. Input would need to be a scheduling algorithm that would
handle the process orders through the workcenters as appropriate. 

# Running:
* First run backend with .Net Core Launch (I use the extension to run it.) This populates the test.json data file
in the UI.
* From simulation-ui, call npm start to start the UI server. This will run the UI on localhost:3000.
