# ManufacturingScheduling

This repository is to be used for prototyping and simulating manufacturing schedulers. The concept is to randomize
workcenters and process orders for a job shop simulation. Input would need to be a scheduling algorithm that would
handle the process orders through the workcenters as appropriate. 

# Running:
* From Core folder, run the simulation tests: `dotnet run`
* From api folder, start backend API server with: `rails s -p 3003`
* From ui folder, start simulation-ui: `npm start`
* UI can be accessed from `https://localhost:3000`
* API can be accessed from `https://localhost:3003`
